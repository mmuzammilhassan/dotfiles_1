# File and directory icons for Vifm (vi file manager)

## Prerequisites
This plugin uses glyphs from a patched NERDfont. So in order for this plugin to work you need to
install a NERDfont and set it as the default font for your terminal.

This plugin is inspired by Alexander Jeurissen's ranger_devicons which can be found here:
https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons

## Installation instructions
There are two ways to install this, the choice is entirely yours but I recommend the latter 
because when updates are released you simply need to update a git repo instead of messing 
with the actual vifmrc file.

### Way 1:
Append the `favicons.vifm` file to your ~/.config/vifm/vifmrc file and restart Vifm to take affect. 

### Way 2:
Append the following line to your vifmrc file:

    source /path/to/your/repos/vifm_devicons/favicons.vifm

Restart Vifm to take affect.
